- Introduction
	- The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan is the single most signficant event in recent human history, causing seismic changes in the very dynamic of the world itself. The upending of the Soviet Union shattered the terror of the Cold War, and lulled America into an age, brief but devastating, of nonchalance and confidence as the only superpower. This age would prove catastrophic, as another product of this conflict, the Taliban, would go on to spawn the most dangerous terrorist the United States had ever faced: Osama bin Laden. Perhaps most importantly, the death of the USSR only increased the reliance that the United States had on China - the reliance that leaves us more and more beholden to the largest Communist nation in the modern world.
	- Soviet Union: world's largest country by landmass, population of 280 million, largest nuclear arsenal in the world
	- United States: 248m people in the world, 2nd largest nuclear arsenal, 2nd largest armed forces in the world
	- Embroiled in the 'Cold War': wherein U.S. and USSR threaten attacks with nuclear weapons (tacitly) to gain compliance of smaller nations to engage in puppet wars (i.e. North Korea vs. South, Vietnam War)
	- Dominant economic powers lead to divisions (namely warsaw pact and nato) between smaller 'non-aligned' countries
	- Iron Curtain: wall of soviet 'satellite' states which provided a buffer against US invasion or launch point for USSR invasion
	- Situation in east/west germany
		- Embargo in Berlin
