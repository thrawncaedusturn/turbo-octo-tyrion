- Minor muj presence allowed them to blend in w/ crowd and avoid detection
- After first three offensives, Soviets sent in tanks w/ sappers to destroy mines
- Tactic failed, 100 dead
- Only made 25 km in, left after casualties mounted
- Massoud (leader of muj) had assembled enough troops to repel Soviets, but placed mines to avoid combatant loss of life
- Pan. 5:
    - 12,000 soldiers
    - May 16, 1982
    - 100 helicopters
    - 25 airplanes
    - Began with bombardment of valley
    - Motorized rifles attacked frontlines
    - Helicoptered troops choppered in behind muj lines
    - Massoud combated by placing troops at entrance
    - Guerrilla offensive strategy by muj helped prevent consolidated destruction of forces (divide and conquer)
    - Soviets establish bases

- Pan 6:
    - Search and destroy missions preceded the attack
    - August through September 1982
    - By hiding with civilians, Massoud lost relatively few troops
    - Offensive losses on soviet side was so high that the soviets agreed to a truce w/ Massoud
    - Fighting still continued in certain small areas

- Pan 7:
    - Change in Soviet govt dictated change in military policy
    - Split in Soviets meant that some agreed with new course of action (destroy everything in valley) and some did not
    - Those who disagreed w/ govt alerted Massoud about impending destruction
        - Massoud evacuated all civilians (30,000)
        - Mines were placed at helicopter landing sites and roads
        - Ruse operation took place near Soviet base
        - 11k Soviet troops and Afghans began to attack
        - Several battalions placed at key passes
        - Blocked muj escapes and covered air with helicopters
        - Soviets occupied mujahadeen infrastructure

- Why it matters
    - Soviets lost far too many soldiers and vehicles to justify war
    - Agreed to pull out
    - Resulted in the downfall of Soviet empire
