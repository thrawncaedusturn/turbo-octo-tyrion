Instead of the subject doing the verb, it **receives** the verb:

**Active: **I gave out homework.  

**Passive: **I was given homework.  

**Active: **I confused all of you.  

**Passive: **You are all confused.  

Uses: 

**When you do not know the doer of the verb:**

The book was stolen!

**When you don't want the doer of the verb:**  

Someone stole the book that was right next to Jose!

**When the subject of the verb is what is emphasized:**
